The team showcased remarkable teamwork and resilience to secure their championship title. Meanwhile, in the Men’s A Division, Fairfirst Insurance delivered a commanding performance, defeating Commercial Credit 78-56 to claim the top honors. <br /> <br /> Praneeth Udumalagala of Fairfirst Insurance was recognized for his outstanding efforts throughout the tournament, earning him the title of Best Player of the Tournament. This year’s MSBA League Tournament featured a total of 636 registered players competing in 122 games, solidifying its reputation as Sri Lanka’s premier corporate basketball event.
